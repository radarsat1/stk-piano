Took screenshots using Grab.
Recorded envelope values using TextEdit.

Identified and implemented basic DSP structure.
4 Allpass filters + delay lines, coupling filter, feedback.
Hardcoded parameters as given in initial state.
Verified that it basically works given an impulse.
(No soundboard synthesis or other commuted linear strutures.)

Found C code in Piano patch that determined some filter
parameters and delay length calculations.  Started
integrating this into the CoupledStrings class.

Replaced two of the Allpasses with a DelayA structure.
Combined Pole and Zero coupling filters into a PoleZero class.

Began to parameterize hardcoded values for the coupled strings structure.
Stiffness coefficient
Detuning frequency, detuning factor
